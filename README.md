# Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Description

Project 3 in Foundations for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). This is my first **HTML/JS** project.

Players submit inputs via buttons, which are put against the computer's randomized choice. First to five points is declared winner.

### Benefits

#### First iteration

- Furthered understanding of functions
- Provided familiarity with the console & debugging process

#### Second iteration

- Established foundation of DOM Manipulation
- Further improved debugging process

## Improvements

Currently, the game is totally functional, but quite ugly! Further improvements might include:
- More interesting theming
- Use of CSS

Additionally, as a first pass at Javascript, this code can certainly be cleaned up. I have already made one brief attempt at this after checking other submitted solutions: rather than redundant if...else statements and handwriting each round outcome, a switch statement with template literals makes for cleaner code.
