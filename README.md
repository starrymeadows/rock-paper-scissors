# Project: Console Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Description

Project 3 in Foundations for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). This is my first **JS** project.

Five rounds are played, each prompting user input and a randomized choice from the computer. At the end of the five rounds, points are tallied and a winner is declared.

### Benefits

- Furthered understanding of functions
- Provided familiarity with the console & debugging process

## Improvements

As this project is meant to be revisited, there are several issues in its current form. These include (but are not necessarily limited to):
- an inability to replay outside of refreshing the page
- and, of course, a complete lack of GUI

Additionally, as a first pass at Javascript, this code can certainly be cleaned up. I have already made one brief attempt at this after checking other submitted solutions: rather than redundant if...else statements and handwriting each round outcome, a switch statement with template literals makes for cleaner code.
